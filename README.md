## Hi, my name is Joao Pedro

I am a Web Software Developer, for the last 2 years I've been developing applications using Typescript and JavaScript
as programming languages.

In my current job, I participate in all stages of software development from planning, testing and
validation.
My tasks range from algorithm analysis, changing codes, fixing bugs, integrating with new
systems and systems deployment.

I've been very interested in software development since the beginning of
the construction, any structure has always piqued my interest in being a FullStack, the area covers any scope providing
great experiences whenever you find a good team.

Current goal: Full Stack JavaScript.
